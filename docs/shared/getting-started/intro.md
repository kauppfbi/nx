# Intro to Nx

Nx is a smart, fast and extensible build system with first class monorepo support and powerful integrations.

## Philosophy

Nx shares the design philosophy with Visual Studio Code. Code is a powerful text editor, and you can be very productive
with it even if you don't install any extensions. The ecosystem of VSCode's extensions is what levels up your productivity.

Similarly, the core of Nx is generic, simple, and unobtrusive. Nx plugins, although very useful, are completely optional.

Because Nx generates the boilerplate for you, most examples use Nx plugins. This maks it easier to demonstrate the features of Nx. The vast majority of features work without the need of plugins.

## Getting Started

- [Using Nx without plugins](/getting-started/nx-core) will help you understand the core of Nx.
- [Adding Nx to an existing monorepo](/migration/adding-to-monorepo) will show how to add Nx to an existing monorepo.
- [Mental model](/using-nx/mental-model) is a good starting point for those who like to understand things theoretically first.

If you want to use Nx plugins to really level up your productivity, pick one of the following guides:

- [Nx and TypeScript](/getting-started/nx-and-typescript)
- [Nx and React](/getting-started/nx-and-react)
- [Nx and Angular](/getting-started/nx-and-angular)
